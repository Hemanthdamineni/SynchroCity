## Introduction
We observed traffic safety researchers invested considerable time, effort, and money in developing a co-simulation tool that integrated Traffic Simulation SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and Unity Game Engine. Each study ‘re-invented the wheel’ and therefore sacrificed resources that could have been used to focus on the ultimate goal, i.e., improving safety. Sumo2Unity tool integrates Traffic Simulation SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) with Unity Game Engine. SUMO2Unity is an open-source project contains the following items: 
1.	It automatically import complex road network from SUMO to Unity;
2.	Integrate SUMO and Unity. This included programming the data exchange between the trajectory coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the vehicles and the signal timing (phase and duration) every 0.10 seconds; and 
3.	Develop performance functions to evaluate the performance of the integration.
   
Sumo2Unity tool usecases: 
1. 3D Enhanced Visualization of 2D SUMO Simulation including roads, trees, building, traffic light 
2. VR/Simulator Human in the Loop Simulation Experiments including simulator car, simulator bicycle and scooter. 


It only requires three steps:

## A User Firendly tool

You can run it without requiring any specific package. You only need SUMO and Unity which both are free tools.
